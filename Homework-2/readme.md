This was an interesting comparison looking at mine and the Ai's version. Listed below is both the Ai's code and script. From my takeaway I am still figuring out console logs and figuring out how versatile that can be. From my favorite website I did not know you can include websites within the log. Another thing I noticed was any item you list can have its own individual log. But just from this takeaway I still have a long way to learn the in and out of console.logs but this was a good starter week to at least experiment to see how it works. 

As for the Ai's model of the work I think the system can provide a very basic outline of the code to have the page working but I tihnk when I start adding my own elements, style, text, etc then it would be considered mine. Like listed below, the AI provided popular artist that everyone knows, which is a pretty generic. As for mine I chose artist based on my favorite hobbies.
